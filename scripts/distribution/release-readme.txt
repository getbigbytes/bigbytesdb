Thank you for downloading Bigbytes, an open-source elastic and workload-aware modern cloud data warehouse.

Get started with a standalone Bigbytes:
1. Edit the configuration files in 'configs' to customize Bigbytes settings.
2. Start Bigbytes: ./scripts/start.sh
3. Run queries with MySQL client or Bigbytes HTTP handler.
4. Stop Bigbytes: ./scripts/stop.sh

NOTE: If you deploy Bigbytes with a self-hosted S3-compatible object storage,
set the environment variable STORAGE_S3_ENABLE_VIRTUAL_HOST_STYLE to 'true' before starting Bigbytes.
